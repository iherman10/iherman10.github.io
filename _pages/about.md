Hi! My name is Isaac Herman, and this is my data science portfolio. I plan to keep it updated with projects I've worked on.

I graduated from Tufts University in 2019 with a major in Quantitative Economics and a minor in Computer Science.

From 2020 to 2025, I worked as a data analyst at Pinterest on the Ads Measurement Research team. My responsibilities included building internal tools for measurement analytics, conducting meta-analyses of various incrementality and experiment solutions, and performing ad hoc analyses using Python and SQL.

Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in data science at _____ (institution to be decided). My interests lie in the fields of causal inference and experimentation.

When I'm not working, you can find me testing new recipes in the kitchen or taking pictures with my film camera. Check out my photo portfolio [here](https://www.isaacherman.com/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
