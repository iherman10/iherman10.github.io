Hi! My name is Isaac Herman, and this is my data science portfolio. I plan to keep it updated with projects I've worked on.

I graduated from Tufts University in 2019 with a major in Quantitative Economics and a minor in Computer Science.

From 2020 to 2025, I worked as a data analyst at Pinterest on the Ads Measurement Research team. My responsibilities included building internal tools for measurement analytics, conducting meta-analyses of various incrementality and experiment solutions, and performing ad hoc analyses using Python and SQL.

Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in data science at _____ (institution to be decided). My interests lie in the fields of causal inference and experimentation.

When I'm not working, you can find me testing new recipes in the kitchen or taking pictures with my film camera. Check out my photo portfolio [here](https://www.isaacherman.com/).
